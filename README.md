## Spec
- 64x32 resolution display (1 bit per pixel)
- 4K RAM (`0x0 ~ 0xfff`)
  - `0x0 ~ 0x1ff`: reserved for system
  - `0x200 ~ 0xe8f`: free RAM
  - `0xea0 ~ 0xeff`: reserved for stack, internal use and other variables
  - `0xf00 ~ 0xfff`: reserved for display
- 8-bit delay and sound timer
- 16 8-bit registers `V0` ~ `VF`
- A 16-bit program counter (`PC`)
- A 16-bit stack pointer (`SP`) (only 8 used, 16 for future implementations)
- One 16-bit address register `I`
- All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first.
- [Complete instruction set](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/CHIP%E2%80%908-Instruction-Set)

## TODO
- Currently not all ROMs are supported.
- Sound support is incomplete.
- Better logging.

## Requirements

You'll need `ninja-build` and `meson` to build. The latter should be at least version `0.56` otherwise it won't work out of the box (you can generally get last version from `pip`). `meson` should automatically detect your default compiler, so any compiler that supports `C11` will do. Finally, the SDL2 libray is needed for gfx and sound.
For a Debian-based system you should fullfill all the requiremens with:
```
sudo apt update && apt install ninja-build libsdl2-dev python3-pip -y && pip3 install meson
```

## Building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnudiego/chipoch.git
cd chipoch
mkdir builddir
cd builddir/
meson
meson compile
./chipoch
```

## Keymapping

The default ROM (Pong) uses `1` and `Q` for player 1 and `R` and `4` for player 2. And `Esc` exits the game.

```text
1 2 3 C        1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D   ->   Q W E R
7 8 9 E        A S D F
A 0 B F        Z X C V
```
